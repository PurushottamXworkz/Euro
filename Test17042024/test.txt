1.What is Java
 Ans: -Java is a programming language.
	  -Java was developed by James gosling.
	  -Java is owned by oracle company.
	  -Java is object oriented language. 
	  -Java is platform independent because once we write program and compile we can run in any operating system.
	  -Java uses 2 commands for compilling and running i,e., javac FileName.java for compilation and 
	      java ClassName
		


2.Explain the architecture of Java with flow diagram
Ans: -Architecture of java consists JDK,JRE and JVM these are 3 major components of Java.
		JDK
		-It stands for java Development kit.
		-It provides kit to develop java applications.
		-there are many different versions in taht jdk 1.8 is stable version.
		
		JRE
		-It stands for Java run time environment.
		-It consists of libraries and JVM.

		JVM
		-JVM stands for Java virtual machine.
		-It is not present in reality.
		-JVM search for main method signature to start excution of java program.
		
		



3.Define class
Ans: -Class is an keyword used to declare object with flower braces.
     - Class consists of variables and methods.
	 -syntax of class is
			class ClassName{
			
			}
	 -While declaring class class name first letter should be in Uppercase rest in small.  		


4.Define data types and explain types and flow of data
Ans:-Data type in java is used to store diffent types of data.
	-There are 2 datatype Primitive and Non-Primitive datatypes.
	-In primitive data type int,byte,short,double,char,boolean,long,double are present.
	-In non0primitive datatype String, Arrays etc are present.

5.Define variable and expain with the syntax 
Ans: -Variable is a container that store value with reference name.
	  Syntax of variable
	  datatype referenceName=value;
	  EX:   String nameOfPerson="Prashant";
	  
	  
	
6.Write a program declare 2 types of datatype and give example for switch case

7.Write a program declare 2 types of datatype and give example for if else (AND and OR)and for loop

8.Explain platform independent and WORA
Ans: Java Is platform independent because
	-Java is written in normal human reable english language it converts in to .class by compilling javac.
	-Once after compilation it is converted into .class file which can be used to excute or run in any operating system.
	Hence it is called platform independent.
	-Once .class file generated we can run any where. i.e., write once and run anywhere.(WORA)
