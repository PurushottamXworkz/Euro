2.	Explain about JDK.
Ans: JDK is a tool kit which is used to develop java projects.

		-It consists of libraries and packages
		-It provides environment to build applications with the help of libries and packages.
	-JVM stands for (Java Virtual Machine)
		-It is a virtual machine, not present in reality.
		-It searches for signature called main and starts program execution.
	

3.	What is bytecode, explain with flow diagram.
Ans: In java programing language , the source code in written in normal human readable format. But, this code is not understandable by machine.
	When javac is called it converts human readable code in to machine readable code that is called bytecode.
	-This bytecode can be execute on any different platform such as windows, mac android and etc.
	-Therefore the java language is also called and platform independent.
	-javac is used to compile code.
	-java object Name used to execute the code.
	
4. Explain a program with switch case.
Ans:  Switch case is conditional statement where condition meets it jumps to execution of that part.
	Else it directly exits.
	class Day{
	public static void main(String args[]){
	int dayNumber=1;
	switch(dayNumber){
		case 1:System.out.println("This is Monday");

		case 4:System.out.println("This is Thursday");
				break;		
		case 5:System.out.println("This is Friday");
				break;
		case 6:System.out.println("This is Saturday");

	 ajja-multilevel inheritance
	 government-hierarchical inheritance
	 vada - multiple inheritance using interface
	 
7.Explain polymorphism with example.
Ans: Polymorphism is nothing but having same name for method and performing different task.
		there are two types of polymorphism 
		1.Runtime polymorphism 2.Compiletime Polymorphism.
		1.Runtime polymorphism it is also called method overriding.
		2.Compiletime Polymorphism it is also called method overloading.
		-hero

8.explain encapsulation with dto example.
